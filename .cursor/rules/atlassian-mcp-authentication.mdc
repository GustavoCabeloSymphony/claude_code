description: Use when configuring or troubleshooting Atlassian MCP (e.g. Jira), MCP authentication, OAuth for MCP, or when ~/.claude.json or MCP config is involved. Covers where to read config, handling stale OAuth tokens, 401/API token policy, and avoiding transport-method cycling.
alwaysApply: false

1. Check `~/.claude.json` for MCP configuration (NOT other locations)
2. If OAuth tokens are cached and stale, a full session restart is required - do not repeatedly retry within the same session
3. If authentication fails with 401, check if API tokens are blocked by org admin policy before trying alternative approaches
4. Never repeatedly cycle through transport methods (SSE, STDIO, OAuth) without user direction - ask which approach to use first
   Add under a ## MCP Configuration section, or merge with the Atlassian section above
